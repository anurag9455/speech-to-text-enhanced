# Enhanced Speech-to-Text System

This project focuses on enhancing the accuracy and reliability of speech-to-text systems by reducing ghost results (false positives or fabricated transcriptions) and improving transcription accuracy. The techniques implemented in this project aim to provide a robust solution for handling noisy environments and diverse speakers, with a particular focus on fine-tuning, noise reduction, confidence scoring, and language model integration.

## Introduction

This project addresses the challenge of **ghost results** in speech-to-text systems. Ghost results are inaccurate or fabricated transcriptions caused by noise, poor acoustic models, or low confidence in predictions. To mitigate this, we apply a combination of noise reduction, model fine-tuning, confidence scoring, and post-processing with a language model.

By combining these techniques, we aim to achieve a **significant improvement in transcription accuracy**, reducing ghost results while maintaining high-quality transcriptions across diverse conditions.

## Techniques Implemented

### 1. Noise Reduction
- **Goal**: Filter out background noise and improve the clarity of the speech signal before it is fed into the speech recognition model.
- **Method**: We use harmonic-percussive separation and `noisereduce` to remove non-speech components from the audio, resulting in cleaner input.

### 2. Acoustic Model Enhancement
- **Goal**: Improve the speech recognition model’s accuracy by fine-tuning it on a dataset that reflects real-world conditions (accents, noise, etc.).
- **Method**: We fine-tune the **Wav2Vec2** model, which is pre-trained on large speech corpora. This makes the model more robust to various acoustic conditions.

### 3. Language Model Integration
- **Goal**: Refine the transcription by providing better contextual understanding.
- **Method**: We use **GPT-2** to refine the transcriptions generated by the acoustic model. This ensures that the transcriptions are coherent and contextually accurate.

### 4. Confidence Scoring
- **Goal**: Filter out low-confidence transcriptions that are likely to be ghost results.
- **Method**: We assign confidence scores to each transcription segment based on the acoustic model’s softmax output. Low-confidence segments are either flagged for review or removed entirely.

## System Overview

The enhanced speech-to-text system follows this pipeline:
1. **Audio Input**: An audio file is uploaded and preprocessed.
2. **Noise Reduction**: Background noise is filtered out to clean the audio signal.
3. **Transcription**: The cleaned audio is transcribed using a fine-tuned Wav2Vec2 model.
4. **Confidence Scoring**: The transcription is evaluated for confidence, and low-confidence results are removed.
5. **Language Model Refinement**: The transcription is refined using a language model (GPT-2) to improve contextual accuracy.
6. **Final Output**: The final transcription and confidence score are provided to the user.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` for package management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-text-enhanced.git
   cd speech-to-text-enhanced
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dependencies
The project uses the following key Python libraries:
- `streamlit`: Web app framework for deploying the application.
- `librosa`: Audio processing and noise reduction.
- `torch`: PyTorch for model inference.
- `transformers`: Hugging Face library for Wav2Vec2 and GPT-2 models.
- `noisereduce`: For applying noise reduction to the audio.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.

## Running the Application

To run the application using Streamlit, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run enhanced_streamlit_speech_to_text.py
```

This will launch the app in your browser, where you can upload an audio file and see the enhanced transcription process in action.

## Performance Metrics

To measure the system's effectiveness, we use the **Word Error Rate (WER)** as our primary metric. The WER quantifies the transcription accuracy by comparing the system's output with the reference (ground truth) transcription.

### Word Error Rate Calculation

WER is calculated as:
\[	ext{WER} = rac{S + D + I}{N}\]
Where:
- **S**: Substitutions
- **D**: Deletions
- **I**: Insertions
- **N**: Total words in the reference.

We use the `jiwer` library to calculate WER for our transcriptions.

## Demonstration and Results

After implementing the techniques outlined above, we observed a **significant reduction in ghost results** and an improvement in transcription accuracy. Below is a summary of the key results:

- **Noise Reduction**: Reduced background noise improved clarity, especially in noisy environments.
- **Acoustic Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the Wav2Vec2 model on a diverse dataset led to a marked decrease in WER across different speaker accents and environments.
- **Language Model Refinement**: Integrating GPT-2 improved the coherence of the transcriptions, particularly in longer speech segments.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Low-confidence segments, often containing ghost results, were effectively filtered out.

### Quantitative Results

| Acoustic Model Fine-Tuning      | 18%        | 12%       | 6%          |
| Language Model Refinement       | 12%        | 8%        | 4%          |
| Confidence Scoring (Low-Conf.)  | N/A        | 6%        | N/A         |
